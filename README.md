# arduino-node-connection
This is a small project to test the connection between an Arduino Uno and a Node js webserver and allows communication between the two.

There is a potentiometer that is hooked up to the arduino which when adjusted will dynamically set an opacity value for a red square that can be found on a simple html page.

The server presents the following page locally. When the dial of the potentiometer is turned the opacity of the red block changes as well.
